<h1>The Vienna University of Technology</h1>
<ol>
<li>
	The conference takes place in the <em>Freihaus building</em> of the TU Wien. On the below map that building is named 
	<em>Campus Freihaus</em> and marked with <em>D</em>.
	The address is <em>Wiedner Hauptstrasse 8-10, Vienna 1040</em>. 
	<ul>
	<li><a href="./Downloads/TU-Lageplan.pdf" target="_blank">Map</a> of all TU Wien buildings.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
	The Freihaus building itself is structured into three vertical areas: 
	<em>red</em>, <em>yellow</em>, and <em>green</em>. 
	<br>
	Upon entering you find yourself in the red area. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In each area there are elevators, a big open staircase, and several (rather hidden) small staircases. 
	The open staircases lead from the ground floor up to the 2nd floor only (ground floor = floor 0). 
	Elevators and small staircases lead further up. 
	The different areas are connected; you can pass from one to another on each floor. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
	The lecture halls used for the talks of the conference are located in the <em>yellow area</em> on the <em>2nd floor</em>. 
	They are:
	<ul>
	<li>FH HS 3 (stands for Freihaus H&ouml;rsaal 3)</li>
	<li>FH HS 2 (stands for Freihaus H&ouml;rsaal 2)</li>
	</ul>
	These rooms are equipped with (very good) blackboards and a projector+computer, but no windows. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Further we use the following rooms which are located in the <em>green area</em> on the <em>3rd floor</em>. 
	<ul>
	<li>Sem.R. green 03 A (stands for Seminarraum 03 A in the green area). 
		<br>
		This is the room for coffee breaks, and can also be used for discussions and work.</li>
	<li>Sem.R. green 03 C. An additional place for discussions and work.</li>
	</ul>
	These rooms will always be open to ensure constant supply with coffee, chalk and blackboard.
	<br>
	<br>
	Here are maps of different floors indicating relevant places.
	<ul>
	<li> <a href="./Downloads/2nd-floor.jpg" target="_blank">2nd floor</a></li>
	<li> <a href="./Downloads/3rd-floor.jpg" target="_blank">3rd floor</a></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
	Registration takes place on Monday from 9'00 to 9'40 and during the first coffee break (11'00-11'45) 
	in front of the coffee room. 
	<br>
	To get there after entering the Freihaus building proceed as follows: move through 
	the red and yellow areas into the green area, there take an elevator to the 3rd floor. When you exit the elevator 
	registration is right in front of you. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Participants who arrive after Monday noon, 
	are asked to personally contact one of the organisers who will then take care of the registration.
