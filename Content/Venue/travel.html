<h1>Travelling to Vienna</h1>
Vienna can comfortably be reached from many destinations. 

<h2>By plane</h2>
The Vienna International Airport is served by most regular airlines and also by several low-cost carriers. 
There are many long distance connections from and to Vienna, and several daily flights to big hubs like London, Frankfurt, 
Amsterdam. Many European cities are connected daily by direct flights. 
<br><br>
Please visit the website of the 
<a href="http://www.viennaairport.at/en" target=blank_>Vienna International Airport</a> 
for detailed information. 

<h2>By long-distance train</h2>
If you come from not so far, it pays to check train connections. 
There are frequent and fast connections from all neighbouring countries (e.g. from Munich, Frankfurt, Prague, Budapest,
Ljubljana, Venice, Zurich). 
<br><br>
Please visit the website of the 
<a href="http://www.oebb.at/en/" target=blank_>Austrian Federal Railways</a> (<em>OEBB</em>)
for detailed information. 

<h2>How to get to town from the airport</h2>
The airport is connected to the city in several ways. We recommend the following:
<p>
	Train service to Vienna Main Railway Station (<em>Wien Hauptbahnhof</em>) with long-distance trains (RJ, IC). 
	Trains are running each 30 minutes from 6'30 till 23'00. 
	For a detailed schedule see the website of the Austrian Federal Railways (OEBB): 
	<a href="http://www.oebb.at/en/" target=blank_>here</a>.
	<br>
	-- Tickets can be bought from a counter of the OEBB (after exiting the luggage hall turn right) or online in advance or 
	onboard the train from the conductor who passes by. 
	<br>
	-- At the Main Railway Station you can change to the public transport service (underground, tram, etc.). 
	<br>
	When bought at the counter train tickets can be chosen to include or to not include a possible following journey with 
	underground/tram/bus. 
</p>
<p>
	Order a taxi in advance. For example from Airport Drivers at 
	<a href="http://www.airportdriver.at/en" target=blank_>this site</a> (there are several similar services of this kind). 
	Especially if you travel in a small group or have more luggage this is a good option. 
	<br>
	-- The driver will meet you at the airport right after the exit of the luggage hall. 
</p>
Other possibilities are:
<p>
	Train service to a local railway station (<em>Wien Mitte</em>) with the regional train S7. 
	Trains are running each 30 minutes. 
	For a detailed schedule see again the website of <a href="http://www.oebb.at/en/" target=blank_>OEBB</a>.
	<br>
	-- Tickets must be bought in advance from a machine and stamped at the platform. 
	<br>
	-- At the railway station you can change to the public transport service (underground, tram, etc.). 
	This following journey with underground/tram/etc is included in the ticket. 
</p>
<p>
	Bus service to several destinations in Vienna with Vienna Airport Bus (<em>Flughafenbus</em>). 
	Buses depart from platforms at the exit of the arrival hall. 
	For a detailed schedule see <a href="http://www.flughafenbus.wien/en" target=blank_>here</a>.
	<br>
	-- Tickets can be bought from the driver. 
	This ticket does not include a possible following journey with underground/tram/etc. 
</p>
<p>
	Get a taxi in front of the airport building. This is usually expensive, and it may happen that there is no taxi available. 
</p>
<p>
	Tourist trap: train service to the local railway station (<em>Wien Mitte</em>) with the City Airport Train (<em>CAT</em>). 
	Trains are running each 30 minutes. 
	For a detailed schedule see <a href="https://www.cityairporttrain.com/en/home" target=blank_>here</a>.
	<br>
	-- Tickets can be bought online or from machines right before or at the platform. 
	<br>
	-- At the railway station you can change to the public transport service (underground, tram, etc.).
